# Promptimal

## üóíÔ∏è Introduction
  Typically, to 3D scan a model into CAD, users have to process a video of their object for hours. This is perfect for getting the most accurate results possible, but engineers often only care about the general shape and ratios of a part in a larger assembly. ScanSculpt gives this type of rough 3D scanning its own process by relying on data from only 3 images, processed in seconds. 

## üõ† Process

  1. The [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/) library highlights the foreground and the background of each of the 3 images
  2. Then, OpenCV masks out the background so only the outline of the object remains
  3. The dimensions of the 3 cutouts can be compared together to properly size and position the pictures 
  4. Finally, the masks are extruded into 3D, and their intersection is saved.

## üéâ Result
The program outputs an STL file of the complete 3D object. It can be immediately imported into CAD, rendering, or slicing software.
