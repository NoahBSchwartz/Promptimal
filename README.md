# Promptimal

## 🗒️ Introduction
  
## 🛠 Process

  1. Developed an automatic prompt engineer by fine-tuning a large language model (Llama2 7b) in Pytorch.
  2. Achieved human-level prompt writing via self-play (automated trial and error).
  3. First to combine the OPRO and Promptbreeder papers with fine-tuning, diverging from reliance on a base model.
